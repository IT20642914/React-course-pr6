This project is a simple Quiz Application built with **React**. It was created as part of a React course project, focusing on state management, components, and hooks. In this app, users are presented with a set of questions and must answer them within the given time limit. At the end of the quiz, a summary of the user's performance is shown, including correct, incorrect, and skipped answers.
## Features

- **Randomized Answers**: Each set of answers is shuffled to ensure randomness.
- **Timer**: Each question has a time limit, and users must answer before the time runs out.
- **Answer Selection**: Users can select an answer for each question or skip to the next question.
- **Summary Page**: At the end of the quiz, the app provides a detailed summary that shows the percentage of correct, incorrect, and skipped answers.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive and works on different screen sizes.

## How It Works

1. The user starts the quiz and answers the questions presented.
2. Each question is timed, and the user can either answer or skip.
3. After completing all the questions, the summary page will display:
   - Percentage of questions skipped
   - Percentage of correct answers
   - Percentage of incorrect answers
4. Users can see their results with the option to review each question's text and their chosen answer.
